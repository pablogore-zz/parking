# **Sample Problem**

------------

#### Build a web application that allows a user to enter a date time range and get back the rate at which they would be charged to park for that time span.

## Requirements

ok 1. Publish a repo on Github that i can clone and run on my local machine
ok 2. Use Java, Scala or C# to complete this.   
	- For JVM - Donâ€™t use Spring Boot, Dropwizard or Scalatra to do this, but feel free to use the libraries employed by those frameworks (eg JAX-RS, Jersey, Metrics, Jackson, Akka, Jetty, etc)
	- For C# - Use .NET Core
maso 5. Unit tests need to be in place
ok 6. API will need documentation and a contract published.  
ok 7. It should support JSON & XML over HTTP  
ok 8. Bonus points for Protocol Buffers
ok 9. I should be able to curl against an API that computes a price for a specified datetime range given a JSON file of rates.  
10. **Optional for Junior** - Integration tests need to be in place. 
11. **Optional for Mid to Junior** - I should also be able to publish that app to AWS/Azure/Google Cloud very simply.  
ok 12. **Optional for Junior** - Metrics for endpoint(s) captured and available to be queried via an endpoint  (eg average response time)

Sample file: 
```json
    {
      "rates": [
        {
          "days": "mon,tues,wed,thurs,fri",
          "times": "0600-1800",
          "price": 1500
        },
        {
          "days": "sat,sun",
          "times": "0600-2000",
          "price": 2000
        }
      ]
    }
```
     
 

Sample result:
Datetime ranges should be specified in isoformat.  A rate must completely encapsulate a datetime range for it to be available.

Rates will never overlap.

2015-07-01T07:00:00Z to 2015-07-01T12:00:00Z should yield 1500
2015-07-04T07:00:00Z to 2015-07-04T12:00:00Z should yield 2000
2015-07-04T07:00:00Z to 2015-07-04T20:00:00Z should yield unavailable
 
Sample JSON for testing
```json
{
    "rates": [
        {
            "days": "mon,tues,thurs",
            "times": "0900-2100",
            "price": 1500
        },
        {
            "days": "fri,sat,sun",
            "times": "0900-2100",
            "price": 2000
        },
        {
            "days": "wed",
            "times": "0600-1800",
            "price": 1750
        },
        {
            "days": "mon,wed,sat",
            "times": "0100-0500",
            "price": 1000
        },
        {
            "days": "sun,tues",
            "times": "0100-0700",
            "price": 925
        }
    ]
}

```
